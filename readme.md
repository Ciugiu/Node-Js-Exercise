# Node Js Exercise

In this exercisie I created a Student object containing the following properties:
- Name: Marie
- Age: 20
- Courses: an empty array

Following that, I used the following methods to manipulate the data of the oject:
- Change the value of a property in the object: Age
- Add a new property to the object: Grade: A
- Used the push method to add elements to the courses array: Math, Physics and Chemistry
- Used indexOf to check the index of the Physics in the array
- Used the slice method to move the first two elements in the courses array to add it to a new array
- Finaly used console.log to log all the modifications
